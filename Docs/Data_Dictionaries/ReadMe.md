The Comprehensive Cars (CompCars) dataset contains data from two scenarios, including images from web-nature and surveillance-nature. The web-nature data contains 163 car makes with 1,716 car models. There are a total of 136,726 images capturing the entire cars and 27,618 images capturing the car parts. The full car images are labeled with bounding boxes and viewpoints.  Parts are: headlight, taillight, foglight, airintake, console, steering_wheel, dashboard, gear_lever.

The Vehicle Make and Model Recognition dataset (VMMRdb) is large in scale and diversity, containing 9,170 classes consisting of 291,752 images, covering models manufactured between 1950 to 2016. VMMRdb dataset contains images that were taken by different users, different imaging devices, and multiple view angles, ensuring a wide range of variations to account for various scenarios that could be encountered in a real-life scenario. The cars are not well aligned, and some images contain irrelevant background. The data was gathered by crawling web pages related to vehicle sales on craigslist.com, including 712 areas covering all 412 sub-domains corresponding to US metro areas. Our dataset can be used as a baseline for training a robust model in several real-life scenarios.  

The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split. Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, e.g. 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe.
