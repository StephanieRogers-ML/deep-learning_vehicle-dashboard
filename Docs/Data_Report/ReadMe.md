## General summary of the data  
The Comprehensive Cars (CompCars) dataset contains data from two scenarios, including images from web-nature and surveillance-nature. The web-nature data contains 163 car makes with 1,716 car models. There are a total of 136,726 images capturing the entire cars and 27,618 images capturing the car parts. The full car images are labeled with bounding boxes and viewpoints.  Parts are: headlight, taillight, foglight, airintake, console, steering_wheel, dashboard, gear_lever.
