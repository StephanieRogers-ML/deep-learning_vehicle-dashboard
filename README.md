#  Introduction  

Modern Dashboards can accommodate a broad array of gauges, climate controls, infotainment, and entertainment systems, which contrast to the earlier simpler controls of only speed, fuel, and oil pressure. Various Automakers have different and distinct ways of designing their dashboards and using a collection of visual identification tools, machine learning and deep learning algorithms we will learn to leverage vehicle features of the dashboard to identify the vehicle and its characteristics. 

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can help identify the content of a vehicle and its features using visual cues from its interior images of the vehicle. This is a multiclass supervised classification problem that will require labeled images to learn the features from curves, edges, and combination of features.
